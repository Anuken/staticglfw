# nim-glfw

This library provides a nice idiomatic Nim API to
[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/). Not all functionality is available through the
Nim API yet; in those cases you can either just use the native C bindings
directly (by importing `glfw/wrapper`) or raise a ticket about the missing
functionality (or even better yet, give a shot at implementing it yourself and
raise a PR!).

Versioning follows the `x.y.z.w` scheme, where `x.y.z` corresponds to the GLFW
version being wrapper (e.g. `3.3.0`) and `w` to the patch version of the Nim
wrapper (e.g.  `3.3.0.2`).

## Installation

The best way to install the latest version of the package is via `nimble`:

```
nimble install glfw
```

## Examples

All examples except `minimal.nim` and `events.nim` depend on
[nim-glm](https://github.com/stavenko/nim-glm).

You can install `nim-glm` with the following command:

```
nimble install glm
```

Compile and run any of the examples by running the following command
in the [examples](/examples) directory:
~~~
nim c -r -d:glfwStaticLib <example>
~~~

Alternatively, you can invoke the `examplesStatic` or `examples` (for dynamic
linking) nimble task in the project root directory to compile all examples:

```
nimble examplesStatic
```

## Usage

This code from `examples/minimal.nim` displays a window for one second and
then terminates:

```nim
import os, glfw

proc main =
  glfw.initialize()
  var c = DefaultOpenglWindowConfig
  c.title = "Minimal Nim-GLFW example"
  var w = newWindow(c)
  sleep(1000)
  w.destroy()
  glfw.terminate()

main()
```

### Statically linking to GLFW

To link statically against GLFW, define the conditional symbol `glfwStaticLib`
(`-d:glfwStaticLib` or `--define:glfwStaticLib`).


## Documentation

No documentation exists currently, but a symbol list can be generated by
invoking these commands from the root directory:

```
nim doc glfw.nim
nim doc glfw/wrapper.nim
```

Checking out the examples is probably the best way to get started with
the library. If you have some familiarity with GLFW, the official GLFW
documentation in conjunction with reading the Nim sources should make
everything clear.

Creating high-quality documentation is a lot of work, so if you would like to
help the project, writing documentation would be a great way to contribute!
